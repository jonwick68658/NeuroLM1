## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Database Migration**: PostgreSQL + pgvector performance vs Neo4j
2. **Connection Limits**: Handling high concurrent users
3. **Domain Switch**: DNS propagation and downtime
4. **API Integration**: OpenRouter compatibility

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Parallel Systems**: Keep Replit running during migration
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Test with subset of traffic first
3. **Rollback Plan**: Quick revert to Replit if issues
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated testing at every phase

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Memory retrieval: <25ms (vs current 100-200ms)
- Chat response: <500ms end-to-end
- Vector search: <10ms for 1M+ embeddings
- Uptime: 99.9%+ availability

### Cost Targets
- Monthly cost: <$100 for current usage
- Cost per user: <$0.05 for 10K users
- 60% cost reduction vs current Neo4j + Replit

### Feature Completeness
- All current features working
- RIAI system performance maintained
- User isolation preserved
- PWA functionality intact

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if critical issues)
1. Update DNS to point back to Replit
2. Notify users of temporary issue
3. Investigate and fix GCP issues
4. Re-test before switching back

### Partial Rollback (if minor issues)
1. Route subset of traffic to Replit
2. Fix issues on GCP in parallel
3. Gradually increase GCP traffic
4. Monitor for issues
