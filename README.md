## 🔬 The Science

NeuroLM implements breakthrough mathematics in artificial intelligence:

**I(t+1) = I(t) + f(R(t), H(t))**

This equation represents the first successful implementation of recursive intelligence - an AI system that mathematically improves its own intelligence through interaction. The specific implementation details of function `f` remain proprietary.
