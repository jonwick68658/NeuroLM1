# NeuroLM - Advanced AI Memory System

## Overview

NeuroLM is an intelligent AI chat system that combines the power of large language models with persistent memory capabilities. The system uses a hybrid architecture featuring graph-based memory storage (Neo4j), vector embeddings for semantic search, and relational storage (PostgreSQL) for user management and file handling. The application provides a web-based chat interface with PWA support and integrates with multiple AI models through OpenRouter.

## System Architecture

The application follows a FastAPI-based microservice architecture with the following key layers:

### Frontend Layer
- **Web Interface**: Custom HTML/CSS with vanilla JavaScript

## Data Flow

### Chat Flow
1. User submits message through web interface
2. Session validation and user identification
3. Intelligent memory system retrieves relevant context
4. Combined prompt (message + context) sent to selected AI model via OpenRouter
5. AI response processed and displayed with markdown rendering
6. Conversation and response stored in Neo4j graph database
7. New facts extracted and embedded for future retrieval

### Memory Flow
1. Every user message generates vector embeddings
2. Embeddings stored in Neo4j with conversation context
3. Memory router classifies query intent (personal recall, factual, general)
4. Semantic search retrieves top-k relevant memories
5. Context augments AI prompt for informed responses
6. Response analysis extracts new facts for storage

### File Flow
1. Files uploaded through web interface or drag-and-drop
2. File content stored in PostgreSQL with metadata
3. File context made available to AI models for processing
4. Download endpoints provide secure file retrieval
5. File references integrated into conversation memory

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **Neo4j Database**: Graph database for memory storage (Neo4j Aura recommended)
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for user data and files
- **OpenRouter API**: AI model access and management
- **OpenAI API**: Text embeddings for semantic search

### Optional Services
- **Redis**: Session storage and caching (future enhancement)
- **Cloud Storage**: File storage alternative to PostgreSQL

### API Keys Required

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Deployment
- **Autoscale Target**: Configured for automatic scaling based on demand
- **Port Configuration**: FastAPI server on port 5000, external port 80
- **Environment**: Python 3.11 with PostgreSQL 16 support
- **Build Optimization**: Container size reduction with cache cleanup

### Production Considerations
- **Container Optimization**: Build script removes cache files and temporary data
- **Security**: Environment variables for all sensitive credentials
- **Scalability**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
- **Monitoring**: Error handling and logging throughout application

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure credentials
2. Set up Neo4j Aura instance and obtain connection details
3. Configure PostgreSQL database (provided by Replit)
4. Obtain OpenRouter and OpenAI API keys
5. Run `python main.py` to start the application
